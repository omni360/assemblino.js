  "readme": "# reducible\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Gozala/reducible.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Gozala/reducible)\n\nLibrary defines higher-order abstraction for reducible data structures -\ncollections based upon [reduce][].\n\nMost functional languages (including beloved JS) typically come with some\ncollection transformation functions like [filter][] and [map][] that take a\nlogical collections and return transformed version of it. Unfortunately they\ntend to [complect][], by implying mechanism, order, laziness and\nrepresentation. This library is an attempt to provide simple solution for\nsome of the hard problems by decomplecting and building upon simple premise -\nminimum definition of collection is something that is reducible.\n\nMore specifically library defines super-generalized and minimal abstraction for\ncollections - a collection is some set of things that, when given a function to\napply to its contents, can do so and give you the result, i.e. a collection is\n(at minimum) **reducible**. In other words, you can call `reduce` on it.\n\n## reducers\n\nThis library provides an abstraction for **reducible** data structures and\nimplementation of internal [reduce][] for built-in data types. It can be used\nto implement to define abstraction for all other types. This is also foundation\nfor [reducers][] - Library for higher-order manipulation of reducible\ncollections.\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install reducible\n\n## Prior art\n\n- [Clojure reducers][]\n- [Haskell Enumerator/Iteratee][]\n\n[Clojure reducers]:http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/15/anatomy-of-reducer.html\n[Haskell Enumerator/Iteratee]:http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Enumerator_and_iteratee\n\n[reducers]:https://github.com/Gozala/reducers\n[reduce]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_%28higher-order_function%29\n[map]:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\n[filter]:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\n[complect]:http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy\n",
